# ðŸ“º Arduino H7 Video Library

The Arduino H7 Video Library manages the video output on Arduino boards based on the STM32H7 microcontroller (Portenta H7, GIGA R1 WiFi), providing functions to draw on the screen and integrate third-party video libraries such as [LVGL](https://lvgl.io/) and [emWin](https://www.segger.com/products/user-interface/emwin/).
